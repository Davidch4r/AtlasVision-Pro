# AtlasVision Pro

[Note Pro is added because this is the second variation]

AtlasVision Pro is a model I have been working on the side which, given any input from the contintential United States and some areas in Canada and Mexico, would output 
a normalized location corresponding to latitude and longitude.

Due to issues with Github's LFS, I cannot currently publish the model itself on github but I plan to very soon [It is around 1 Gigabyte].

The training process works in a very similar fashion to the game Geoguessr, where a random location is selected through Google Map's API and through Deep Learning the 
model learns to guess.

Currently not finished but hope to continue workingo n it in the future.
